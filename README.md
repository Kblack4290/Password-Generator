# Password-Generator  
!(https://kblack4290.github.io/Password-Generator/)

My objective was to create the logic for the password generator to create a random password. The password would need to meet a certain criteria that will be set by the user. The character options the user is able to choose from is:

* Choose the character length of the password between 8 and 128.
* Confirm if you would like lower case letters.
* Confirm if you would like upper case letters.
* Confirm if you would special characters. 
* Confirm if you would like numbers.

If the user chooses any number less tha 8 or greater than 128 then the user will be alerted to follow the instructions and will need to click the button to start again. 

If the user chooses the a correct password length then the user will prompted with questions to confirm their character options. If the user does not choose any of the character options (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, or numbers) then the user will be alerted to choose at least 1 character option to generate a password. 

If the user selects and appropriate password length and has selected at least 1 character option then a random password will generate from the confirmed criteria set by the user. 

If the user would like to create another password, then the user can click the button again to start their password criteria over.
